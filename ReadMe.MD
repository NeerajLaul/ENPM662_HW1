
## Overview

This project contains two Python scripts for robotics kinematics calculations:

- `problem1.py`: Simulates the 2D trajectory of a rear-wheel drive vehicle based on given wheel angular velocity, steering angle, and initial pose using the derived kinematic equations.
- `problem2.py`: Computes symbolic forward kinematics, Jacobian, velocity kinematics, inverse velocity kinematics, simplifications, and numerical verifications for a 3-joint planar robot arm.

Both scripts use symbolic computation with `sympy`. Additionally, `problem1.py` uses `numpy` and `matplotlib` for numerical computations and plotting.

## Files

- **problem1.py**  
  Implements the kinematic model of a rear-wheel-drive mobile robot, numerically simulates the 2D trajectory of point O given initial pose and motion parameters, and plots the resulting path.

- **problem2.py**  
  Computes symbolic forward kinematics, Jacobian matrix, velocity kinematics, inverse velocity kinematics, and verifies results with simplifications and numerical substitutions.

- **requirements.txt**  
  Lists all Python package dependencies:

     sympy
     numpy
     matplotlib

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies:

       pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run `problem1.py`

- Run the script using:

  `python problem1.py`

- When prompted for **initial values**, enter:

  `0,0,0`

  (this sets the starting pose \(x_0 = 0, y_0 = 0, \phi_0 = 0\)).

- The program will then ask whether to use **manual** or **random** values:
  - Type `M` to enter your own:
    - `omega` → wheel angular velocity  
    - `alpha` → steering angle in radians  
  - Type `R` to use random values automatically generated by the program.

- The simulation will then run and display the **2D trajectory plot** for the specified conditions.


3. Run `problem2.py`:

   - The script prints symbolic expressions for kinematics, Jacobian, inverse kinematics, their simplifications, and numerical evaluations.
   - No user input is required and the script will run automatically.

       python problem2.py

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- sympy (for symbolic math)
- numpy (for numerical calculations)
- matplotlib (for plotting in problem1.py)

## Notes

- `problem1.py` uses symbolic expressions converted to numerical functions for simulating the robot's motion.
- `problem2.py` focuses on symbolic derivations with a detailed breakdown of kinematics and Jacobian-related matrices.
